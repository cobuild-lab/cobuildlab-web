      <DetailParagraph>
        Born as an idea on April 20, 2017, to attend a national cannabis march in Chile, surprised
        with the call and massiveness, Oscar Lopez decided to create something to unite all the
        community, and from there emerged the idea of a social network. As he delved deeper into the
        idea and the Chilean cannabis culture he realized that the market and opportunity were much
        bigger than he expected and at the same time the worldwide cannabis culture begins to have
        high traction: it was a case of perfect timing.
