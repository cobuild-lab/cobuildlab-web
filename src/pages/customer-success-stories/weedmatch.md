## Biography of weedmatch

Born as an idea on April 20, 2017, to attend a national cannabis march in Chile, surprised with the call and massiveness, Oscar Lopez decided to create something to unite all the community, and from there emerged the idea of a social network. As he delved deeper into
the idea and the Chilean cannabis culture he realized that the market and opportunity were much bigger than he expected and at the same time the worldwide cannabis culture begins to have high traction: it was a case of perfect timing.

## How everything started:

Oscar met Angel Lacret in the university, he knew that he was programming but they lost contact, sometime later they retaken contact by
Facebook and Oscar remembered that he had a development company and decided to contact him to develop the **Weedmatch** project through Cobuild. During several months we chat about the Cannabis industry and its trends, and how the lifestyle world was in debt of tools for this community. 

After a couple of meeting Oscar develop the concept of the brand with several of its partners and the shape of the Weedmatch app started arising. It was until beginnings of 2018 were we setup a team and start working in this project.

We made an application for **mobile Android** and **iPhone** that allows you to contact the people closest to you, interested in the cannabis culture. Allows you to match and create a chat to chat and know the interests of those people. 
The application was develop using **React Native** and **Django frameworks**.

The project lasted approximately four and a half months with a **back-end programmer**, a **front-end programmer**, a **typesetter**, and a **Qa**. Working as a team with the client and holding daily meetings, the first beta of the application was developed and then functionalities were added. Currently, the project is already live and all the Chilean community loving cannabis enjoys it.
