        I met Robert Mitchell, Head of IT for Massone about 3 years ago, we started since then
        working on possible solutions to improve the workflow for the company, we try different
        version of ERP applications and Third Party solutions. More than a year ago we realized that
        to improve Massoneâ€™s processes a Custom Application needed it to be developed, we spend
        several months reviewing the current process on the Company and what to do to improve them.
        Finally, we lock down a budget to start with the solution around September of 2018, in
        January 2019 we released the first version and we keep adding new features until today.

        Like any project, doubts and concerns arise about the achievement of the objective: to
        satisfy the client`s needs. In the beginning, there were many obstacles, problems with
        development, many changes in requirements (which were accepted). After completing the first
        phase there was a functional product, which met its measure with customer satisfaction.
        There was always communication with it, and a lot of support and understanding on their part
        to achieve this product that continues and hopefully will continue to grow with us.
