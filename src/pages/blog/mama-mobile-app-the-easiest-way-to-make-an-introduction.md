Miami, FL. July 27, 2020 - The second phase of development for MAMA's mobile app has begun and its trial version is expected to be released later this year, confirmed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/">  Angel Lacret</a>, Chief of Product Development and Cobuild Lab's CTO. <br> </br>

MAMA is a social platform that aims to connect people through the introductions from individuals we know, like, and trust; an acquaintance that acts as a “matchmaker”. Its founders <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-keeler-971599156/">  Ana Keeler</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/s2a/">  Derek Stout</a> wanted to connect people to expose endless opportunities for friendship, love, and professional connections. They teamed up with <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/">  Cobuild Lab</a> a couple of months ago to start developing a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/amp/">  mobile app</a> that will allow you to make professional recommendations, introductions between friends, meet interesting people, and expand your network. <br> </br>

We started <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/planning-a-software-project/">  planning the software project</a> for MAMA by holding previous meetings with Ana and Derek to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/cobuild-process-part-1/">  validate the idea</a>, and then we planned the development process, where we divided the project into three stages. The first stage of the project has already been completed in which we framed the app’s interface, creating a foundation for the functionalities that would be added next. <br> </br>

Earlier July, the second stage of this project was confirmed and is already underway, "We are developing a function that allows users to connect two people either romantically or simply for business, introducing the information (phone number or e-mail) of both so they can get in touch through the app" comments Angel Lacret. The app is being developed with a user-friendly interface and a notification function has been added as well, "the app will send a notification via SMS to the individuals who are being introduced, it contains a link that directs them to the Google Store to download the app. Once downloaded, it automatically connects you to the other person your friend or acquaintance wants to introduce you to" he added. <br> </br>

The goal is to be able to launch its <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/minimum-viable-product/amp/">  MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</a> to start building a user base. In the second stage, a variety of functions are being added. "To make possible a conversation between two strangers we added functions such as sending and receiving text messages, it will also be possible to record and play voice notes. To take this to the next level we’ve also added the function of recording video messages". Lacret said.  <br> </br>

The third stage will consist of incorporating the introductions to the app through a chat so when I invite people we’d like to introduce, they will have to download the app and connect through the platform. Stay tuned for more updates on MAMA's Project, thank you so much for Reading.  <br> </br>
