Find the LinkedIn package that suits your B2B Tech company from the several different packages available. The first level is the free LinkedIn package that is available to every individual and company that signs up to LinkedIn. Though this basic package is useful in keeping a network of business friends and co-workers, it is limited in terms of features that would be needed by a B2B tech company. <br> </br>

A good level of package that suits businesses is the premium package, as it has more advanced features. The following are the available different pricing levels for different needs: <br> </br>

·         Premium Career Account - $29.99/month <br> </br>

·         Premium Business Account - $47.99/month <br> </br>

·         Premium Sales Account - $64.99/month <br> </br>

·         Premium Hiring Account - $99.95/month  <br> </br>

Note that the above Business, Sales, and Hiring account are billed annually. Learn the importance of each feature for you to maximize the features in a new package before purchasing it. <br> </br>
