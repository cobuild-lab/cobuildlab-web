Today entrepreneurs talk and hear about business models and business strategy. Will it be the same? In this article, we will know it.

<title-3>Business Model (Meaning)</title-3>

<Br>

A business model is the representation of the architecture of the company you have or want to start. In it, you must contemplate your initial ideas, the pivot, your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/validating-your-idea-the-first-step-to-create-your-startup/"> validations </a>, your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/value-hypothesis-and-growth-hypothesis/">  value proposal </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/buyer-persona-and-customer-archetype-for-software-business/">  market segment </a>, scalability (expected), and in general, the value chain from the idea to make effective the purchase and consumption of your product or service by the consumer. 

It is to think about raw materials, essentials, production, investment, and all the production processes you expect to have. 

The business models even contemplate the market segment you want to reach. 

What you need to offer your value proposition and how much it will cost. 

It is a complete and general document that defines and articulates the life, evolution, and action of your business. This concept applies to all industries, not only to software companies or software as a service company (SaaS).

<title-3>Business Strategy</title-3>

<Br>

On the other hand, a business strategy is a specific plan that will lead you to fulfill commercial or business objectives. 

In fact, more than the plan, it is the decisions you make about the actions you will execute, the path, the people involved, and all the information required to achieve a specific objective. It is usually linked to the commercial area.

<title-2>What Was the First? The Business Model or Business Strategy?</title-2>

<Br>

You've probably asked this question on more than one occasion, and many authors have written about it, although opinions vary. 

But most scholars confirm that it is the strategy first and then the business model. 

You first think about a goal where you want to go. And then you define the whole structure and operations to meet that objective.

It is likely that throughout the life cycle of your business, you will have to change your business model and even your strategy because they go hand in hand. 

The business model facilitates the strategy. This happened to many businesses this 2020. They had to change their strategy in the face of the social changes that took place, and this promoted the digital transformation and the digital markets (business model). 

<block-quote>In conclusion: a business model and business strategy are not synonymous, but they are related.</block-quote>

<title-2>Business Models Possibilities for Software as a Service Companies</title-2>

<Br>

<title-3>* On-Premise:</title-3>

<Br>

This business model presupposes that the software was correctly installed within the client's internal structure. This type of model has great advantages since it allows for modifications to be made depending on the client's needs at any time. The simple integration with a client's corporate system server is another advantage that makes this IT company's business model attractive. A disadvantage, it needs space and technical capacity. 

<Br>

<title-3>* Cloud-based:</title-3>

<Br>

This is a method in which the software works in the cloud service or at a hosting provider. You can access your information from everywhere in the world as long as you have access to the internet. It is not necessary to download any mobile application. Nowadays, more and more companies are opting for cloud hosting such as <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/es/">  Amazon Web Services </a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/">  Microsoft Azure </a>. 

<Br>

<title-3>* Hybrid:</title-3>

<Br>

It is a combination of on-premise and SaaS models that allows its customers to have their application installed on-site and also take advantage of cloud services. This business model for software development is highly sought after by enterprises because it is very flexible in terms of data transfer between cloud services and on-premise data centers, as well as allowing large capacity files to be sent and upgraded easily. It also allows for the storage of confidential data on-site.
