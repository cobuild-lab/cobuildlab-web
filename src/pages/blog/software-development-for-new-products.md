The interesting thing about software development is that although your goal is always to build a product, there are many alternatives on how to do it, from a framework to the activities of the type of product to be developed and even the methodology of each development team. 

For this reason, we want to show you the way we work. The methodology we use for software development when we engage in the construction of new products for startups.


<title-2>What is Software Product Development?</title-2>

New product development refers to all actions that you must complete to create a new product, a value proposition that did not exist before to be released to the market. In this particular case, we would be talking about a software product. 

If we had to be more specific, we would define this process as the transformation of a market needs into a software product for sale or mass consumption. 
The development process of new software products is more of a methodology that we decided to establish internally. The reason? You will understand it later. Read a little more.


<title-2>Key factors of New Product Software Development?</title-2>


<title-3>1. The methodology</title-3>

We use a mix of two frameworks: [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/) and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).

The framework provides a series of tools, artifacts, and values that you should use, but how and when to use them, you decide. 

That's why we talk about that if we put together the tools of our framework (SCRUM+XP) with the how and when we use them, plus the activities that characterize software development, and we are in a project to develop a new software product, the result we get is a methodology to improve the product. 


<title-3>2. Management of end-user needs</title-3>

The development of new software products takes into account the needs of individuals, a specific market segment that is going to consume the solution. 

Based on that, a brainstorming is made to develop the user stories and the user interface of the first version of the app or the software with a minimum of technical requirements. 

This happens differently in the other methodology, which is Enterprise software because the needs of the end-user that are taken into account are those of work teams of an organization, and the technical and quality requirements are a little more rigorous.

<title-3>3. Quality Assurance and Security</title-3>

In the development of new products, especially of MVPs or prototypes, the rigour in the quality is not so high. The objective is to conceive a functional product, which may even have some bugs that will be corrected in later versions. 

What is important is to define the functionality and user experience, as well as the properties of the product and its purpose: the solution. 

The opposite happens in software development for companies, where even minimum quality and usability criteria are established, which must be achieved even in the first versions. That's why we say that quality is much more rigorous. 

The same goes for security. In the development of new software products is much more relaxed the level of protection in use and for users than in enterprise software development, and for this reason, is one of the critical factors of this methodology of software development. 

<title-3>4. Monitoring and Analytics</title-3>

Monitoring in new software product development projects is the key to understand [Customer Behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour). A new product is introduced to the market with a high level of uncertainty, requiring feedback at all stages to understand and drive the development of new features and changes.

<title-2>Software Development Process for New Products</title-2>

To get to know our methodology, we must explain the process we follow when we have ongoing projects of this type. 


<title-3>1. Requirements</title-3>

In this phase, we conduct interviews with those who had the initial idea, and who are the ones who want to offer the solution to the market. 

We review the evidence and results of validations processes to understand the customer perspective towards a possible solution.

In this same step, a first analysis of the market is carried out, potential customers and other apps or similar solutions that have already been developed in that space or that are in the development process are studied.

<title-3>2. User Stories</title-3>

As we well know, [user stories](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/user-stories/) are made up of two components. A technical specification and User Interface (UI) screens. 

First, based on the knowledge obtained from the previous step we brainstorm and create two prototypes of how the User Interface will present the solution to the problem using a navigation map:

![]()

Once this process is completed we move into developing the actual User Stories. We describe each of the features that users will have available on this initial version of the Software with the minimal technical requirements.

<title-3>3. Development</title-3>

Development, as its name implies, is the step where the software product is built. 

The key in this phase is the checklist known as the [Definition of Done](https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/02/definition-of-done/), where we can determine if a user history is built.


For new Products the Definition of Done usually looks like this:

* Code Review it
* Integrated to the main repository
* [Product Owner](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner) has validated the feature against the User Story.

<title-3>4. Product Quality</title-3>

The quality of new product development is measured with usability tests. 

A person that generally is the Product Owner, one or some of the Stakeholders or even the entrepreneur use the product developed to determine if the product is used or not and if it passes minimum quality requirements. 

The quality checks for a new product are very loose. As or the main goal is to have a working product to test the solution against the potential customer, excessive-quality may translate into higher costs and times to perform those tests.

Initial our goal is to reach early adopters, and people who are willing to test the early versions of the product, and this type of users usually understands that flaws and bugs are common on new products.

<title-3>5. Release</title-3>

In this process, we set up two environments: testing and production. 

In the first one, it is where the code is developed, and all tests are performed. While the second one is the environment where the final code is uploaded after the tests to be exposed to new users.

When you develop a new product, the releases cycles are very short. One or two weeks are the expected time to release new features to new users.


<title-2>New Products developed at Cobuild Lab</title-2>

Developing new software products is our major expertise, and beyond commenting on how we do it, we want to show you some of the projects that we have already completed. 

<title-3>Weedmatch</title-3>

![weedmatch](./media/weedmatch.jpg)

[This project](https://weedmatch.cl/) was enjoyable and different. Weedmatch is the first free cannabis social network for Latin America. It was developed by a group of Venezuelans led by Oscar Lopez. 

This app goes directed to the Chilean public who are part of the cannabis culture. With the app, you can know events; you can interact with other people, and be an active part of this community in Chile. 

This app allows you to contact the people closest to you, interested in the cannabis culture. Allows you to match and create a chat to chat, and know the interests of those people. 

We made an application for Android and iOS using React Native and Django frameworks adapt it to the methodology explained before. 

["The project lasted approximately four and a half months with a back-end programmer, a front-end programmer, a typesetter, and a Qa. Working as a team with the client and holding daily meetings, the first beta of the application was developed, and then functionalities were added. Currently, the project is already live, and all the Chilean community who love cannabis enjoys it"](https://cobuildlab.com/customer-success-stories/weedmatch/)

<title-3>Ezonseller</title-3>

![Ezonseller](./media/ezonseller-logo.png)

The need to sell something and make a profit for it is the oldest trade in the world. This principle has governed trade for years, and as markets grow, there is more competition, and the profit margin may not be the same, diminish or be altered in some way. 

[Ezonseller](http://www.ezonseller.com/) helps you with that and makes it more accessible. It identifies the products that people are buying and tells you where they are selling them most affordable so that you can buy them, provide them to the plaintiffs and make a profit on it. 

It is a process of research, purchase, and sale that develops this new product that we made by the hand of Steve Rogers, an entrepreneur who in 2011, discovered this business opportunity.

"The work that was made with Steve, in the development of the new product, was implemented through two frameworks: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (framework of python with which the API was developed) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) (framework of javascript with which the views were developed), the work deals in itself with the comparison of prices of products between the platforms [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/). Several modules were developed in the application such as account management (login, registration, password recovery), management for product searches through the mentioned platforms, plan and payment management (creation, edition, elimination) and credit card management through the [stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment platform".

This is our methodology for Software Development of New Products and some of our experiences. 

If you have a question or even a suggestion, you are welcome to contact us, if you need help with the development of your project, we can help, and if you only liked this information and want to know more of our methodologies, as the Software Development for Enterprise Applications, very soon we will share it. Greetings!
