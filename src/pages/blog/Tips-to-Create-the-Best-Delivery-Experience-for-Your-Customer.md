The delivery of your product or service is more than just a process is an experience that you provide to your consumer, and every day that passes is a key differential factor for the brands. 

Consumers want their delivery to be fast, transparent, effective, and with that, your reputation in the market is at stake.

<title-2>Tip 1: Evaluate the Strategy You are Using to Make Your Submissions</title-2>

<Br>

Is your product or service arriving quickly? At the time your customers expect? Is the value of your delivery competitive in the market? You should ask yourself these essential questions, and if the answer to any of them is not satisfactory, evaluate, and rethink that strategy because it directly affects the key points of the delivery experience. 

What you must take into account to rethink the strategy is the needs and expectations of your client. 

* Do you need to know where the order is going? Incorporate real-time tracking in your software. 

* Do you need speed in delivery? Incorporate mixed transport or additional cups to speed up delivery, and manage them with software.

<title-2>Tip 2: Make the Buying and Shipping Process Simple and Clear</title-2>

<Br>

You may wonder why we talk about buying? The answer is that shipping is part of this process, and delivery is much more than just the move. 

If it’s easy and understandable, your consumers will feel good, and they will like it because they’ll know what to do and what to expect. 

For example, include sections in your web or app where you can explain the purchase and shipping process to the customer, and make it as simple and minimalist as possible, FAQs, etc. If it's easy to understand, it will be easy to execute, and this quality suits both you and your customer.

<title-2>Tip 3: Be clear and Estimate Your Delivery Dates Correctly</title-2>

<Br>

There is no worse violation in the delivery experience than failing the customer with the estimated receipt time of the product. 

The consumer will wait that day to enjoy your product or service, and if it fails for some unknown reason and delays, this will give them a negative experience.

<title-2>Tip 4: Offers an experienced post-purchase solution</title-2>

<Br>

As we told you, the delivery experience begins before the product is shipped. 

For example, if the person already made his purchase, you can send to his mail the status or tracking of your package before they even ask for it.

Post-purchase solutions in the shipping experience allow you to communicate with your customers before delivery and even after.

Those details make all the difference.

<title-2>Tip 5: Manage and track your customers' delivery experience and your own as a supplier</title-2>

<Br>

Knowing this information is useful for many things. You can rely on software from the market or develop your own for your business. 

<Br>

<title-2>Tip 6: Analyze your Delivery and Traffic Data so You Can Often Optimize Them</title-2>

<Br>

No matter how predictive a system is, it is always a good idea to take into account your experiences so that on future occasions, you can predict or calculate the times and value of your experience. 

Your customer will value the improvement, especially, if they have used your service more than once. 

<Br>

<title-2>Tip 7: Personalize the Delivery Experience as Much as You Can</title-2>

<Br>

Your consumers will like this. For example, offer points for every purchase and shipment they make, and every so often make discounts  or express deliveries without charge for their loyalty. 

Offer fast or next day delivery as much as you can. 

Make exemptions for some people, depending on the place of delivery. 

Surprise your customers with details that even your shipping system can channel. 

That customization also makes the difference.
