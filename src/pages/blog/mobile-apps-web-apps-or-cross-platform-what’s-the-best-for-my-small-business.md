<title-2>Mobile Apps vs. Web Apps</title-2>

<Br>

Mobile apps are built for a specific platform, such as Android for a Samsung Galaxy or iOS for the iPhone. You can download them and install them by an app store and they have access to system features like the camera or the GPS. These apps live and run on the device itself. Instagram, Twitter and TikTok are some examples of popular mobile apps.
Web apps, on the other hand, are accessed by browser and will adapt to any device you’re using them on. They don’t need to be downloaded or installed and they’re not native to any specific system. Due to their responsive nature, they have a similar look and functionality to many mobile applications— which may lead to some confusion.
