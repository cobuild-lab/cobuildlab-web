As the person in charge of your team, you should encourage communication with each of them in several ways. By improving communication with them both at work and outside, you can bring many benefits to your organization, such as increased productivity and loyalty. 

The lack of communication between you and your team only creates confusion, and very rarely will they be able to understand each other. Here are some practices that you can implement to improve communication and the relationship between you and them:

- Schedule meetings 
- You must always recognize the positive, which means that every time your team brings a new idea, project, among others, you must recognize them and find ways to make them feel important. 
- Make job satisfaction surveys.
- If there are conflicts, resolve them by talking like adults and professionals.
- Always look for the most appropriate channels to communicate with your team. 

As a recommendation try to develop a closed platform exclusively for communication between you and them, so you can accelerate the processes and improve productivity. 

Another option is using software tools that already exist like [Gmail](google.com), [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/es-ve/), [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/?trysignin=0), and so on.

As a good leader, you must recognize the good performance of your employees, and you must encourage them with prizes, gifts, among others. This way they will perform better because they want to win the prize.

If your team is motivated and has a desire to grow and perform well in the workplace, your company is bound to do well. It's reciprocal.

Get used  to giving a little freedom to your workers. Being always on top of them creates a heavy work environment and increases distrust.
