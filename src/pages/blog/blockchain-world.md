**Blockchain**: the revolutionary technology that is miraculously impacting different industries was introduced in the markets with its very first modern application Bitcoin. Bitcoin is nothing but a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) which can be used in the place of fiat money for trading. And the underlying technology behind the success of cryptocurrencies is termed as Blockchain.

<title-2>Blockchain definition</title-2>

Blockchain is a data structure that holds transactional records and while ensuring security, transparency, and data decentralization. 
It is a chain of files stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority. They are compone by millions of algorithms and numbers almost impossible to decode because each block contains information from the above, and this makes it safer. 

A blockchain is a distributed ledger, is entirely open to any and everyone on the network, but the information stored on the chain, it is tough to change or alter it.  Each transaction on a blockchain is secured with a digital signature. Due to this, the data stored on the blockchain is tamper-proof and cannot be changed.

This is the main character because the blockchain technology became famous and rentable for business.

Blockchain technology allows all the network participants to reach an agreement, commonly known as consensus. All the data stored on a blockchain is recorded digitally and has a shared history which is available for all the network participants. This way, the chances of any fraudulent activity or duplication of transactions is eliminated without the need of a third-party.

<title-2>How Does a Blockchain Work?</title-2>

A blockchain contains data or information. Each block of blockchain network stores some information along with the hash of its previous block, as we explained before. 

A hash is a unique mathematical code that belongs to a specific block of the chain. 

Suppose: data inside the block is modified, this means that the hash of the next block will be changed too, and the next, and so on. Thanks to that, blockchain is secure.

While transactions take place on a blockchain, there are nodes on the network that validate these transactions. In the blockchain, these nodes are called miners, and they use the concept of proof-of-work to process and verify transactions on the network. For a deal to be valid, each block must refer to the hash of its preceding block. The transaction will take place only and only if the hash is correct. If a hacker tries to attack the network and change information of any specific block, the hash attached to the block will also get modified.

If there is a breach, it will be detected immediately as the modified hash will not match with the original one. This ensures that the blockchain is unalterable, and any change which is made will be reflected throughout the entire network.
