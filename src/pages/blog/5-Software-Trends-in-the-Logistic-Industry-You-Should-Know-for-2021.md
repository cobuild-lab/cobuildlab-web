Trends are a reflection of the most effective methods for companies in a market, which represent an opportunity to solve situations or problems that arise, and are a challenge to overcome for the coming year. We could not close 2020 without mention some trends in specialized **software in the logistics industry**. Those technologies favored the industries beyond the difficulties brought to us by the coronavirus.

<title-2>1. Artificial Intelligence Keeps On Revolutionizing the Logistics and Supply Chain Market</title-2>

<Br>

Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize all industries and will continue to do so because it can reach even beyond the capabilities of human beings. 

Artificial intelligence can be used for the planning and prediction of routes, for product or service demand, and for predicting the rotation of inventory and supplies in warehouse management. Today robots are starting to be used in the logistics processes management, as allies of humans, and some of them can work with artificial intelligence. This is undoubtedly a trend in this and many other industries in the years to come.

<title-2>2. Digital Twins for Logistics Processes</title-2>

<Br>

Do you know what a digital twin is? They are replicas of objects or processes that simulate the operation of the homologous to analyze the effectiveness and improve it over time. 

They are digital representations linked to the physical system.

This technology works hand in hand with the Internet of Things (IoT) because it links digital technology with physical infrastructure. 

Thanks to digital twins, you can collect information about your supply chain, for example, and discover its weak points and find ways to strengthen them. 

You can also create prototype tools that can help you with the storage or distribution of your products. 

In general, with a digital twin, you can monitor your logistics processes.

<title-2>3. Sustainability Beyond the Use of Technology</title-2>

<Br>

Think about what decisions you can make to transform your supply chain or logistics process more environmentally friendly. For example, you can use micro-mobility devices that work with electricity to make your deliveries. It doesn't matter how you do it or if it involves technology. The important thing is that you think about making your processes sustainable for the environment, and of course, communicate it, make your potential customers aware of it, and if it's possible to spread it to your suppliers. Many are the benefits of this trend. This 2020 the awareness around this topic intensified, and we hope it will continue to happen.

<title-2>4. Efficient and Automated Storage Management</title-2>

<Br>

This year we had to be more predictive than previous years because of the effects of the pandemic. It was more difficult to replenish inventory and supplies, make deliveries, and generally keep logistics processes afloat. 

That's why many companies had to improve their storage capabilities, automate many processes with software tools, and even robots for handling the warehouse, and this will have to continue improving in the coming years because everything points to this being our new reality. 

With companies such as Amazon offering same day delivery options the pressure is on to deliver faster without compromising on quality. It ensures fast packaging processes and open communication lines internally and externally. Avoids communication failures and improves trust among those involved.

<title-2>5. Prediction, Risk Assessment and Planning Take Center Stage</title-2>

<Br>

This 2020 we learned that anything could happen. External agents can significantly alter our lives and productive processes. Some things are impossible to prevent, but there is the technology that can help you evaluate and analyze the possible risks that may exist in your supply and logistics processes, and based on that, make plans to face those changes. 

Prediction, risk assessment, and planning already existed and were put into practice in the past, but now efforts must be redoubled to achieve that goal more effectively. Being prepared is important. You can do this with external equipment, but you could even use artificial intelligence to do so.
