<title-2>Some Benefits of Custom Software on Process Automation</title-2>

1. Perhaps the main advantage of developing custom software tools to automate various processes within your company is that you will have absolute compatibility between tools. This makes it possible for you to create and develop your ecosystem.

For example, suppose you want to integrate a specific task manager with Gmail could be incompatible, but if you have your internal communication system, you will be able to make all the integrations you want, and your tools (no matter how far from the process) will be compatible for sure. 

2. Security concerns stayed in the past. One advantage to take into account is the security percent on the customized software development. You work hand-in-hand with developers, and that brings you the possibility to decide where, how, and when your data will be stored. This is so important at this point because you sure work with sensitive information about your processes.
Better support at the moment of some help with your software since the service is personalized.  

3. You reduce human or manual errors. The human being always has a margin of error, but if you support your processes in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, or a simple app, the margin of human error will surely decrease, and this has a direct impact on productivity. 

4. You can track and control all processes simultaneously, and depending on the scope of the software tool, it could even be in real-time. 

5. You can more easily standardize and measure your team's performance indicators. 

6. There is a very interesting advantage related to the identification of waste points. These points are the areas with low levels of productivity or with some essential fault that prevents the correct functioning of the productive processes. 

7. Previously it was possible to identify them only when they were very evident or when the process had already been completed and had to be repeated due to this point of waste. It is a matter of efficiency, better use of raw material and resources. Thanks to process automation, you can work on these points before it is too late or you have lost too much time and money.
