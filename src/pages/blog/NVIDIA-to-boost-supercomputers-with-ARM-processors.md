NVIDIA announced that it will offer support for the ARM architecture from the next year, in order to accelerate the implementation of its technology in supercomputers with low power consumption processors. This was confirmed by Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, who said he will make his software development kits, compilers and CUDA-X libraries available, among other things, to the British company ARM in 2020.
 
NVIDIA‘s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

Now, the company is making available to the Arm® ecosystem its full stack of AI and HPC software — which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks — by year’s end. The stack includes all NVIDIA CUDA-X AI™ and HPC libraries, GPU-accelerated AI frameworks and software development tools such as PGI compilers with OpenACC support and profilers. Once stack optimization is complete, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and Arm.

With this, the American company already supports the three main architectures: x86, IBM Power and ARM. Currently, the HPC terrain is dominated by the x86 architecture. It is precisely this market that NVIDIA is targeting, who for some time stopped focusing only on GPUs for graphics applications and now devotes a large part of its budget to powerful chips that drive supercomputers focused on artificial intelligence.
 
 It seems that with the boost of both NVIDIA and ARM, the x86 architecture will have a complicated future, especially in the field of high-performance computers.
