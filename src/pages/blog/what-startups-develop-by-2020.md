It is expected that the market of edge computing is not going to increase by two-three or four folds! Edge computing global market is predicted to rise by approximately 28 times by 2025.  

Do you have any idea behind this trend? What makes researchers believe that edge computing is going to show such drastic growth? This is because it is being used to upgrade cloud computing, which is itself a growing and embraced technology. 

How is edge computing better than cloud computing? Edge computing has an advantage for remote areas where connectivity to a centralized location is poor. Moreover, it can be used to process data that is time-sensitive, whereas cloud computing cannot be used for this purpose.

It was in 2016 when introduced instant apps to the software development world. These apps have features of an app but run like a website. You do not have to download them, which means there is no need to provide them memory from your device. Instant apps can also be used for testing purposes. Mobile app developers launch these apps to test their mobile apps before their launch. They are smaller in size than usual apps and offer a better user experience.
