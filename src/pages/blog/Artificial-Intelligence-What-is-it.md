<block-quote>_"The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”_  
[**Alan Turing**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87041.Alan_Turing) - [**Mechanical Intelligence.**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/764008)</blockquote>

We used to say that computers were obedient, that it was strictly what we programmed it step by step, like a recipe for cooking. Today **artificial intelligence** manages to find results and conclusions without being explicitly programmed, but they discover them by making an **automatic** analysis of the data that is offered to them. Is this good or bad for humanity? Let’s talk about it!

<title-2>Artificial Intelligence is...</title-2> 

A collection of advanced technologies that allow machines** to sense, comprehend, act and learn. It is configured to transform the studies, medicine, business and the apps in ways never seen before (only in science fiction). When this technology is implemented in the correct way, it helps to improve productivity, solve problems and reduce costs, unlocking more creative work and creating new growth opportunities. 

<title-2>Advantages of AI</title-2>

*   Exploration capacity.
*   Reduction of errors.
*   Increased personalization of the information received.
*   Better performance than humans.
*   Faster information processing.

<title-2>Disadvantages of AI</title-2>

*   Vulnerable to attacks.
*   Risk related to system hacking
*   Abilities of people will diminish.
*   Robots as effective weapons.
*   Economic problems.

<title-3>Have you heard about the Turing test?</title-3>

First of all, who is Turing? Turing was a British mathematician and logician. He is considered one of the fathers of computing and modern computing. During Second World War worked on decipher the Nazi codes, particularly The Enigma Machine. Then designed one of the first digital programmable electronic computers. If you want to know more about his history and how he designed a machine capable of deciphering Nazi codes, I recommend you watch the movie “The Imitation Game”. 

The Turing test is a series of questions that an interrogator (human) must ask questions to a computer and to a person without knowing who is the human and which is the machine, the idea is that if the person asking cannot differentiate between the human being and the machine, it must be considered an intelligent entity. 

An inverse form of the Turing test is widely used on the internet as the CAPTCHA test (an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”) that is designed to determine if a user is a human and not a computer. 

Artificial intelligence is flourishing in many areas: robots investigating the progress of climate change, virtual assistants and computers that control the world of finance. 

**Google**  

Since 2012, YouTube offers the possibility to subtitle the videos automatically. The platform recognizes what people said in a video and creates subtitles. Once you have the text, it can be translated into any of the 55 languages that Google Translate. To train and improve their voice recognition systems, both Google and its competitors, Amazon and Apple, need hundreds of voice hours recorded in real situations. This is one reason why virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant or Alexa are free: they allow these companies to obtain hundreds of thousands audio hours recorded by users in their day to day. 

Google showed a new assistant system based on artificial intelligence, if you were already surprised by all the functions that google assistant has, you will be amazed by the new intelligent voice that they have developed called google duplex, which will make the calls that you indicate, Google Duplex makes reservations appointments like to cut your hair x day x hour or reserve a table in a restaurant. If you want to know more I invite you to see the Google Keynote I / O 2018 on Google developers Channel - Youtube. 

In the future you will not only ask voice recognition questions to Google Assistant with your mobile phone or with Google Home devices, you will also do the same with your car’s Internet of Things (IoT) device and with any other IoT gears such as mirrors, smart TVs, your fridge and so on.
