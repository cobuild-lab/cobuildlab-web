Designed as version control system, GIT began to operate for the reason of maintaining operations and efficiency of applications when having a large number of files and codes.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management **(SCM)** functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.   

Projects on **GitHub** can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git pluginshave also been created by **GitHub** and other third parties that integrate with the platform. 

When GitHub started in 2008, everything was shared. A person of high purchasing power could get an account and share their open source with the world, or by remote control and have access to their source code.

His focus expanded, from simply publishing Git central locations in which data is stored and managed to help people build software as a team.
