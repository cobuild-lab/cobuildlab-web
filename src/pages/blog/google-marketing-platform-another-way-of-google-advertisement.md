For many years we knew that Google offered us advertisement options on two platforms: Google Adwords and Google AdSense. Since July last year, that panorama changed a little with the launch of a platform called [Google Ads](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-create-effective-campaigns-in-google-search-engine/), which came to replace Adwords. And together with it, two more tools were launched. One of them is **Google Marketing Platform**, which we will talk about in this article.


<title-2>What exactly is Google Marketing Platform?</title-2>

In a few words, Google Marketing Platform is a new tool from the technology and information giant that integrates marketing and web analytics services. 

Its main objective is to help us plan, buy ads and also measure their performance, to optimize our campaigns more efficiently. And all that, with just one tool. 

The Google platform integrates Google Analytics 360 Suite services and Doubleclick products as well.
