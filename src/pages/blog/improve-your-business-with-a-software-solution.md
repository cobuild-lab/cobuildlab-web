Miami, FL. Apr 9, 2020 - On today's uncharted territory, let's remember what John F. Kennedy once said: "When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of two characters, one represents danger, and the other represents opportunity." That is, be aware of the danger but recognize the opportunity. <br> </br>

And history has taught us that every major crisis gives us opportunities to grow and evolve. So, this moment doesn't necessarily mean the end of your business, but the chance to give it new life through a brand new company-client dynamic. <br> </br>
