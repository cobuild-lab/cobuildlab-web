<title-2>8base is now sponsoring our Meetups</title-2>

Miami, FL. May 09, 2019 - We are really thankful for the support that [8base](https://www.8base.com/?utm_source=PressRelease&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=monday_13_05) is giving us, they are now one of the sponsors for our
Meetups. Every Monday we get together to share our knowledge about Javascript and Python, showing the best practices and patterns 
and also teaching new technology to our community. We want to offer a space where developers can share their problems and doubts 
with others and together find the most efficient solution.

8base is a platform that empowers developers to create software application quickly and easily. Is an amazing solution for those 
front-end developers working independently because their mission is to build and run applications removing the need for back-end 
developers.
