<title-2>Google and Huawei are no longer working together</title-2>

Miami, FL. May 21, 2019 - This Monday, Google suspended Huawei’s Android license, the company can only use the version of Android available through the open source license that is free to anyone who wants to use it. However, current users of Huawei phones with Google apps will continue to use and download app updates, says a spokesperson of Google. Huawei has been building its operating system for smartphones and computer, preventing the blockage from Google and Microsoft. The company has been trying to separate itself from American Technology, making semiconductors and designing its chips for smartphones.

This move from Google comes after the Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist, declaring a national economic emergency to ban the technology and services of “foreign adversaries.”
