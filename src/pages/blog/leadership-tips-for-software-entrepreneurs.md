In essence, the leader is the person in charge of developing and making the project grow.

You know the idea, and the value proposition of your project, that is why you should guide the team.. For this reason, we present some tips that will help you find and develop the leader within you.


<title-2>Now, enjoy these Leadership tips</title-2>


<title-3>1. Make a template of your management</title-3>

When you have enough information for establishing activities and goals for the team, develop your plan and present it in a template to the them. . That way, everyone will know the macro plan and better understand just how important each of their responsibilities are.

In the development of a software product, every piece is fundamental, it has to work like clockwork. If any member doesn’t fulfill their responsibility or reach the goal assigned, they will affect the whole development cycle of the project, wasting time, and in a best case scenario, you will lose money. At worst, the quality could be affected, hindering your company’s growth or even damaging your company’s reputation. 

<title-3>2. Be as humble and accessible as you can</title-3>

Humility, empathy, and confidence are essential characteristics of a leader. When you are responsible for many aspects (technical or not) you are likely to feel pressured. Or on the contrary, if you feel so comfortable in a position of authority that can change your kind attitude, respect, empathy, and openness for other members of your team. Avoid this type of situation, since you would go from being a good leader to a bad boss, and this position is an antonym to the expected one.

<title-3>3. Communicate as much as you can with your team</title-3>

You can use any tools you want for this or do it face to face. The most important thing is that you always talk to the people who make up your team. This way, they know each other and get along better. With better communication you will be able to better motivate your team, transmit ideas, and get immediate feedback from those who are going to support you to make your dream a reality. 

<title-3>4. Identify and set your priorities, then share them</title-3>

There are important, unimportant, urgent, and non-urgent things. There is a prioritization exercise in which a picture is drawn divided into four spaces with these characteristics in each sector. The division would be this way:

[![leader-management](./media/leader.jpeg)](#)

<Br>

The prioritization exercise consists of finding a balance between things that are urgent and things that are important, and based on that prioritize activities, goals, and everything that the team must undertake. This sense of prioritization is necessary to be effective and efficient in the final result, to work in an organized way based on the plan you make. But this effort must come from you, and then your team will follow your guidelines and even be able to prioritize their activities by their own initiative. 


<title-3>5. Listen more, talk less</title-3>

Meeting team members, listening to them and making them feel important, because they are, is another of the qualities and tips for being a good leader. By listening to expectations, doubts, concerns, suggestions, and any information from your team, you can get valuable data that would help you to improve processes, activities, and even final results. A leader should merely be the head of a complete team.


As an example, it could happen that according to your own personal methodology you perform a certain task in a certain specific way, maybe not the best way. By listening more and keeping the channels of communication wide open with the rest of your team, you’ll create a culture where if one of the members of your team considers that your way it’s not the best way to proceed, they could present to you with another way that could work better than yours. By just listening and being open to your team’s opinions it could bring exciting things to them, to you as a leader, and of course to your project.

This doesn’t mean that you should not have your own criteria, or that you are not going to speak your mind. You must give guidelines and above all, instruct and inform your team, but no matter what type of leadership you choose, listening to others is a leader’s *sine qua non..*

<title-3>6. Be as honest as possible</title-3>

Openness is a good leader quality. It is not synonymous with being rude, so be careful with that. But you should speak clearly, openly, and sincerely to your team members, partners, allies and everyone who will be involved in your project. In all forms of communications, whether public or private, you should be as transparent, open ‘and’ active as possible. This quality is known as effective communication. 

For example, if you want to communicate to one of the guys on your team, a message that you find uncomfortable or not the most enjoyable. It’s important that you try to meet him, be helpful, but tell him transparently what's not working. Doing it in person is essential and valuable. 

<title-3>7. Define the roles and responsibilities of each person</title-3>

A good leader knows the strengths and weaknesses of everyone involved in their project; if not, r try to discover them at least. And based on that, the leader will establish responsibilities and roles within the team. 

It would be wrong if, for example, you put a layout designer to work in the back-end of your application. Although the person may have a conceptual idea of the back-end. They most likely will not be able to contribute at all to your team, you must identify their strength and make the most of it. 

Sometimes, the best teams aren't made up by the most talented people in the world. They are rather a well-engaged team, working to their strengths, each member adding their grain of sand to get an excellent [software product.](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/)

If you’re not an expert in the technicalities of Software Development, you may feel your team is incomplete, but remember you could ask for help from a software development company or also a [technical co-founder](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/co-founders/). Whatever it is, make sure that each person has an  assigned responsibility, that they know it, and that  matches their strengths. 

<title-3>8. Create your formula</title-3>

Each leader has their own methodologies, formulas that may have worked for them in previous processes, or that might have been validated as successful with other analogies. But what is most certain is that there is always a method behind every leader. If you can define your own methodology, refine it, spread it, and make the rest of your team feel identified with it, you have won a great battle. 

Impositions usually are a leader’s worst enemy. Especially in the area of software development where often the person or founder who had the initial idea, is not a software specialist and must surround himself with people who are. Show your team how your plan can succeed. Set smaller goals in the beginning, and make sure they are met successfully. These early victories, will motivate you as well as your team. Just please don’t be that boss that runs everyone ragged.

<title-3>9. Feedback, alignment, and elimination</title-3>

As tasks, activities, and objectives are completed, it is good that you give feedback to each member of your team and vice versa, putting in the same effort to listen to feedback from the team as you did to give it to them

Now, with this information, you must fine-tune the necessary details; eliminate what is not required and align the rest so that the software development process runs smoothly and effectively. 

<title-3>10. Always be learning</title-3>

Even if you can sell ice to Eskimos, it’s important to realize that a leader never stops learning. Leaders are always learning from their environment, from their team, and from everything they can.

<title-3>11. Think of a legacy</title-3>

High-performance teams are achieved because they have a great leader who takes the time to train them,  as well as  continuously encouraging them to be leaders in their area. A leader sees the potential in every member of their team, believing that each and every one of them has the capacity of leading a team, of completing tasks, and of working organized under the same philosophy, because that’s what they have been taught. 

Now you could be released of some responsibilities because you will have a trust-worthy team. In case you have to disengage yourself of some process at some point, someone else will be able to replace you without affecting the performance of the team. 

Maybe your position requires you to represent your company in another way. But now you will know that the company will still thrive even if you are not there for a while. That's what it's all about, creating a legacy. Putting together a team that represents the ideals that you and them stand for.

<title-3>12. Commitment, commitment, commitment</title-3>

The best leader commits fully to a project, maintaining that commitment over time, and until he or she executes it, their commitment never fades.  The bar you set for yourself should be higher than the rest, that’s because a major effort is expected from the leader, and all this without mentioning that your commitment must be contagious for the team. It is imperative that you find the tools to do it, this is a sure way to guarantee your team’s growth and performance. If your colleagues and teammates grow, they develop themselves; the result will be the growth of you and your software project. It's a win-win equation.

As your colleagues and teammates continue to grow, the quality of their work and those around them will grow as well, creating a chain reaction resulting in the growth of your team as well as that of your company, start-up, or software project.

Being a software entrepreneur is not an easy task. On the entrepreneurial side, you must be an excellent leader and motivate your team to give the best of themselves, and on the software side, you should have at least a basic knowledge or support from an expert, so that the technical quality of the product being developed is the highest possible, making use of the right tools, and in general, following the [software development process](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/best-software-development-process/) correctly.
