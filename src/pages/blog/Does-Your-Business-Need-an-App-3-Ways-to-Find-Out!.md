With more businesses shifting towards mobile-based marketing nowadays, maybe it's time you developed a strategy that targets smartphone customers as well. Many companies are looking to stay one step ahead of their competitors by targeting smartphone customers, and it's only understandable. Recent statistics show that over 60% of all searches are done via smartphones. 

One of the best ways to optimize your services for such consumers is to build an application for your business. Apps make everything more streamlined and easy to work with, especially when dealing with complex websites. Looking at the face data, creating a [mobile application for your business](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/android-vs-ios/) might be a good idea. 

However, there are also other factors that you should keep in mind when it comes to app design and development for your business. In addition to the fact that you will be competing against your competitors' apps, you will also be competing for space on the customer's mobile. Many smaller businesses often make the mistake of creating an app for their business without doing the proper research and then getting disappointed when it fails. 

Here are three ways to find out whether your business needs an app or not:

<title-2>Does it provide more value than your website?</title-2>

Before even thinking about designing an application for your business, you should first review your website. Is it optimized for mobile customers? By [implementing proper SEO](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/seo-tips-that-will-increase-your-position-in-search-engines/) and website design strategies, you can optimize a website for smartphones as well. It will save you from having to build an application. 

It would be best if you also looked at whether the app is bringing any additional features that your website does not have. For example, it may be easier to categorize products or make the checkout process much faster.

If there is a clear advantage of an application for your businesses' model, you can opt for an app. Otherwise, it will merely be a waste of funds as the app does not provide any additional value.

<title-2>Do you have a loyal customer base?</title-2>

Another thing to consider before designing an application for your business is whether you have a loyal customer base that will always prefer your products over the competitors. While most companies like to think that they already have a [loyal customer](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/buyer-persona-and-customer-archetype-for-software-business/) following, it is more complicated than that. 

Try and look at whether your customers are so attached to your product or service. Will they prefer to install your app in place of a more exciting game or social media app? You can also check whether any competitors are making use of applications and what is their success rate. It will help you determine whether it is suitable for your business or not.

<title-2>The nature of your product or service</title-2>

<Br>

Your product/service nature is the primary factor that you should consider when it comes to app design for a business. In most cases, a customer downloads a particular application because they mean to use it often. You can review your business's product or service and look at how frequent a customer purchases from you. 

If you own an e-commerce store, then an application could be necessary. Still, the same cannot be said for lawyer services that a customer might seldom need. A customer's loyalty doesn't need to be determined by whether they install your app or not. In many cases, the business model is not made for a mobile-based application, and customers prefer using your website. 

Next time you are faced with deciding whether to design an application for your business or not, keep these factors in mind to determine whether it is necessary and practical.
