<title-2>What is digital transformation?</title-2>

<Br>

We can say that digital transformation brings together a series of technologies to reinvent the processes of different industries, cultures, and customer experiences, in order to increase the production of companies, improving the productâ€™s characteristics and making consumers happier using software and technology.  

Today, digital transformation is very important for businesses since it is the only way that companies can keep up to date, improving their performance. That is why if you want to position your company in the market and be one of the most competitive, you should bet on this type of process without a doubt. 

[It is also important to know that global spending on technologies and services is expected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2023.](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45612419)

* One of the main characteristics is to have a very good approach to what your customer needs, only then you can improve your products, be more at the forefront of the market, and meet the needs of consumers. 
* Another important feature is that the processes within your company should be well defined and standardized, this to improve the performance within your company and make it more productive. 
* There must be a good relationship between the data and the processes, so that everything works correctly, without any setback, so that all the information is in order

<title-2>Phases of Digital Transformation</title-2>

**Phase 1:** 

To carry out a digital transformation process, you must first take into account the cost savings and investment necessary to carry out all the digitalization and try as much as possible to optimize the work within the company. 

<Br>

**Phase 2:** 

Prioritize the list of processes or areas where you can apply this transformation. Go from the highest ROI to the lowest.

Evaluate 2 or 3 potential solutions to integrate into your business. Hint: consider Artificial Intelligence is a very powerful tool impacting all the industries.

**Phase 3:** 

Build a network and reliable business ecosystem to provide complete solutions that ensure success in the marketplace and at scale.
