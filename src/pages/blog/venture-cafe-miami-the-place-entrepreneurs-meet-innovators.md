Ms. Buchanan, in 2014, founded the Nyah Project, a nonprofit fellowship that gives underserved youths in **Miami-Dade** transformative
experiences abroad and has astounding college acceptance and scholarship rates. That led her to Venture Café, a platform created at the
Cambridge Innovation Center in Boston as a way to create opportunities for communities by providing “connective tissue” between innovative
entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors.

Venture Café Miami in 2016 it was the fourth of its kind in the world. Today, there are eight, including overseas operations in Rotterdam,
Tokyo, and Sydney, with more on the way.

Venture Café began in 2009 as an experiment by **the Cambridge Innovation Center** (The home for great entrepreneurs leading fast-growing
companies since 1999) to bring together innovators and entrepreneurs to engage in spontaneous conversations and semi-curated programming,
they’ll come up with innovations to make the world a better place and generate economic growth.

Venture Café Miami's mission is to improve and grow Miami's community of innovation through the exchange of ideas that is only the
beginning of this entire project, which has as its mission to be a vehicle to connect people and stimulate innovation. Venture Café Miami
creates the forum to connect innovators who ultimately seek to create positive change in local and global communities.
