## **How does it work?**

It is a new portable computer (this is composed of a wireless remote control and headphones connected by cable to a pocket PC) designed to draw a spatial map of the surrounding environment and create the illusion that digital objects are in the same environment as the person using it. 


The glasses contain the screens, audio, and sensors of the external camera. A handheld controller with a touchpad and a system that connects to a round computer that attaches to your body and makes everything work. In June 2018, the company's first headset, **Magic Leap One**, did introduce for the first time, later in July, the device confirmed its use of _NVIDIA TX2 hardware_. 


This same year _AT&T_ invested in the company and will become its exclusive partner, with Magic Leap One being the first product to be sold only in AT&T-owned stores throughout the United States.
