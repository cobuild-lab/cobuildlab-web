Welcome to this new article where you can get some tools and tips to get the most out of your **team's time and tasks**, increasing your company's productivity. 

You should implement technology in your company through task management tools, such as the ones we’ll show below. The business world is in constant change, so don’t stay behind and sign up on this world of [digital transformation](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-digital-transformation-and-how-can-small-businesses-take-advantage-of-it-this-2020/) and grow your business.  Let's begin!

<title-2>Yes, having the right time and task management is very important</title-2>

<Br>

Task management is an essential issue since it helps you increase the productivity of your team, and therefore, of your company. First, you must start by understanding what work management is just the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities during the development of any project. 

When we manage a team, we have the responsibility to assign tasks, follow them, provide help (when needed), close these activities when they are done, and why not? Evaluate productivity. 

All this process would be easy with just a member or a few people inside, but when the team grows or if it's big, this work turns more challenging. That’s when technology comes to save us. 

You must take into account that good work management allows you to work more intelligently, even decreasing the time of work. Not managing time harms efficiency and causes stress (for you and the team).   

Some benefits are :
- Greater productivity and efficiency.
- A better professional reputation.
- Less stress.
- Increased opportunities for advancement.
- Increased opportunities to achieve important life and career goals. It's about personal and commercial growth.

Task management software aims to provide help with specific tasks. 

You can add tasks, name them, categorize them, and also define the start and due dates.

<title-3>There is another term we want to talk to you about, and that is “project management”</title-3>

<Br>

Project management is a little more than task management because it involves planning, organizing, collaborating, and delivering many different activities, and sometimes even more than one team. It is similar to task management but in a macro way. 

There are excellent software tools that can help you with this, and best of all, many of them serve both purposes. That is, collaboratively managing tasks and projects.
