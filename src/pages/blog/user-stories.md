<title-4>4. Focus on what and why</tittle-4>

Sometimes, could happen that a person is not specific in his or her user story. At that moment, you only need to know what he or she wants and why. 

To have more information, you can describe in a few words the person profile. That can help you to understand better.

<title-4>5. Make it public</tittle-4>

If you compare the results of each user story, you will profit the content. Always it’s a nice idea to make it.


<title-3>A bit of history</tittle-3> 

Some years ago, exactly at 1998, Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and said: “A user story is a promise for a conversation.” This will be the beginning of user stories. 

Specifically, with Xtreme Programming XP was the first-time user stories were on the table. From there, they usually are used in agile and scrum development’s process. 

Now you can use them and take advantage of the market thanks to them.
