The starting point for success is realizing that you can learn from everything around you - people, places, experiences - and that is why we are constantly learning from the successes and failures of others, as we grow through their experiences.  Having reference models to look at is key for professional growth since this is a survival mechanism; if there is no growth, a company dies.  And let's face it, life never gets easier, it's you who gets stronger; and what better way to get stronger than by learning from those we admire. Having a 'role model' applies not only to personal growth but also to business, because if there are companies in the same industry as mine I want to know what they are doing well, what can I learn from their actions and what can I adapt for my company. Their mistakes and lots will become my gains, as I learn what didn't work for them, can I do better? Once we understand that we are in constant movement, growing and learning, we will know that there are no limits to what we can be, have or do to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. <br> </br>

In the tech world - our world - there's always something new and more interesting that catches our attention and we must keep up with changing trends. Even though maybe Miami isn't your first call when you think about startups, at least not compared to New York, Boston or Silicon Valley which are more closely associated with the entrepreneurial activity; Miami is the second most entrepreneurial city in the U.S. according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://indicators.kauffman.org/">  Kauffman Index</a>, and in this segment, we'd like to talk to you about some Miami-based startups that have gained relevance lately. <br> </br>

There are many industries that we can tackle, but one that has become more prominent than ever is the health-tech industry. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen">  Covid-19 pandemic</a> has accelerated the pre-existing situations and needs of the health industry, removing in its course some irrational prejudices against the use of technology in healthcare; a good example of this is the use of telehealth for remote patient care, the idea was aberrant and marginalized for a long time before COVID, and as of today is a fundamental tool for the care of suspected or positive cases with mild symptoms and also avoids crowding in health centers. Health technology, also known as "health-tech", involves the use of technologies developed to optimize the health system. Healthtech companies have realized that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to proper care, experiences need to be customized to each individual, so personalization is key. In this context, the best example of personalized attention is Telehealth. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="centered"> What is Telehealth? </title-4>

<img src="./media/cariehealth-1.jpg"> <br> </br>
Telehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support a variety of health care services; and although previously they were mainly used for patients living in rural areas who didn't have easy access to doctors and had to travel a long distance for a medical appointment, more recently it’s used for patients living anywhere. The technologies to use depend on the need that comes up and resources can be used such as: <br> </br>

* Video chat or video calls using computers or smartphones to allow you and your doctor to see and talk to each other in real-time. 

* Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) in which devices can be connected over the internet are used to check blood levels or blood pressure.

* Online healthcare platforms allow you as a patient and your health care provider to send and receive messages. You might also be able to see your test results, current prescriptions, upcoming appointments, and more.

According to a May 2020 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare%20Systems%20and%20Services/Our%20Insights/Telehealth%20A%20quarter%20trillion%20dollar%20post%20COVID%2019%20reality/Telehealth-A-quarter-trilliondollar-post-COVID-19-reality.pdf">  McKinsey report</a>, healthcare providers used telehealth solutions to allow 46% of Americans to replace a canceled healthcare visit with a telehealth service during the pandemic and now by using telehealth solutions, more suspected COVID-19 positive patients can be quarantined in the safety of their homes without having to sacrifice medical care. Again, just a very few people can see opportunities during a crisis, Carie Health, a Miami-based startup in the healthcare industry had set the bars for telehealth, and could be making it a permanent part of the healthcare toolkit, for our communities, today and the days to come. <br> </br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.carie.com/">  Carie Health</a> is a health solution that aims to reinvent the patient care experience using the mobile tools we all know and use on a daily basis. Founded in 2016 by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattwanderer/">  Matt Wanderer</a>, the company is based on a unique business model that links physicians with technology to provide high quality 24/7 health care service available to everyone at a very affordable cost. Remote healthcare delivery is safe and effective when the right parts are in place, which is why Carie Health has proven to be more than capable of adopting all available tools to improve healthcare. <br> </br>

<title-5 align="left"> More convenient </title-5>
According to the American Medical Association and Wellness Council of America, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ortholive.com/blog/just-the-facts-30-telehealth-statistics-for-doctors-to-know#:~:text=Nearly%20Almost%2075%25%20of%20all,and%20Wellness%20Council%20of%20America."> 75%</a> of all doctor, urgent care, and ER visits are either unnecessary or can be handled virtually; and we can all identify with the traditional trip to the doctor's office when we clear our schedule because we are aware of the inordinate amount of time we will spend in the waiting room even when we have an appointment (for which we have been waiting for days). That's why Carie Health relies on Telehealth to break down all distance barriers by bringing health care to the palm of your hand no matter where you are. For those who are in a rural area, where accessing a health service is complicated, the benefit of being able to have a remote health care service 24 hours a day is immeasurable. <br> </br>

<title-5 align="left"> Reducing costs </title-5>
At a cost of about $50 at the top end of the fee scale, telehealth represents a significantly lower-cost alternative to emergency care or an emergency room visit, which can typically range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, respectively. The platform is completely free for users and providers becoming an additional source of revenue for their practice. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="centered"> How does it work? </title-4> <br> </br>
Carie Health is actively using a variety of technologies for its website, including Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Analytics. With an eye-pleasant, elegant design the platforms show an intuitive interface making it easy to use and navigate. In a few simple steps you can receive medical care where and when you need it: <br> </br>

*  As a first step, you create an account either as a provider or a patient.

* You can use the geolocation feature to contact the health provider closest to you if you prefer.

* Once you have chosen the health care provider you wish to consult, you can join their Virtual Treatment Room form the patient portal, and explain your motives for consultation.

* The provider will be notified via SMS text and their dashboard will show that a patient is waiting to be seen, and they will be able to start the virtual consultation.

* The provider will be able to make notes, keep track, and even prescribe prescriptions from the platform so that the patient can easily download and print their prescription from the comfort of their home. <br> </br>
