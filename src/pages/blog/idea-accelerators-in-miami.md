<block-quote>“A startup is a company working to solve a problem where the solution is not obvious and success is not guaranteed”</block-quote> 

Neil Blumenthal, co-founder, and co-CEO of Warby Parker.

In the last decades at least, certain small ventures and companies have been labeled with the word “startup”, associated them with certain elements in their context: innovative disruption, high uncertainty, bootstrapping, accelerate growth (potentially) and in many cases been in the tech space or driven by tech experts. In all these years many differ in the elements that a new company has to have to be called a “startup”, but what all of them agree is one specific concept: **uncertainty**. Due to this, this types of organizations had always in required for help, for people with skills in different areas, solid experience an resourceful, and from this is where the concept of Accelerators and Incubators comes into place.

In simple terms, Accelerators and Incubators are companies that aim to help entrepreneurs and startups to growth, slightly in different ways. Incubators usually help build concepts or ideas into disrupting products or top solutions, and accelerators usually help this type of solutions to scale properly. Again, in this concepts, many people have different definitions that are somehow similar and somehow different, but equal in purpose. This companies also classified themselves in the stage of the company, idea or concept maturity, and this is where the term Idea Accelerators comes into place.

<title-2>What is it idea acceleration?</title-2>

An Idea Accelerator can be considered as a Startup Accelerator focusing on the Development Stage. This development stage also is known as the Seed Stage or Idea Stage, it’s the earliest step in the creation of your venture when you have that idea that you want to transform into a business but you haven’t achieved yet the proper validation. 

It implies good professionals in different areas, models, techniques, appropriate tools, plans, and tests to transform the main idea into a real and sustainable business.

But you have to be careful. It is not the same talking about startup acceleration than idea acceleration, and people tend to confuse them. Later we will explain better this point.

For now, we will talk about where you can accelerate your business idea in the sun’s capital: Miami.

<title-2>Idea acceleration vs Startup acceleration</title-2>

How we said before, these terms are usually considered like synonyms, but they aren’t. To be more specific, startup acceleration  an idea acceleration are different phases when you are developing a company.

They could be together, but also you can use one without the other one. This principle is the best reason to know that they are not the same. 

A startup is a small business which is in its first steps, and tend to be related with technology. When we are talking about startup acceleration, it means that you already have an idea probed and you should have a small team working on them. Actually, for this you are looking for an accelerator. 

But, if your idea needs to be improved, but you will have to go back and you could lose time, money and some other resources. 

Now, if you look for help from the beginning, you will have the opportunity to evaluate your business idea with experts who could make it better. Because they are taking in considerations some necessary aspect to create the best version of your business project, you can drastically reduce the probability of failing. 

In this case, we would be talking about idea accelerators.


<title-3>Which are these aspects to accelerate an idea?</title-3>

1. Market necessities and desires
2. Pricing issue
3. Business model
4. Customers profile
5. No passion for the market
6. Viability 
7. Capital

At first, you can think that they are not important, but trust us, they are really important to improve your chances for success. 

So, it comes usually to this: if you have an idea, what do you think that should be the first step? Create your Startup and try to accelerate? or shape your idea first and then create your company?
