Before 1960 most software was **free and open-source enterprise**; this was because the programs needed a little development assistance to make the program better over time. Over the years, that slight help changed to more complicated support, this led to more significant software package development efforts, making software licensing a market trend. 


<title-2>But What is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</title-2>

Open source means that you have access to the source code even for modifying it, and free software is related to having access to software for free, without any pay, differently of the open-source, which could have a price, usually low. 

For this post, we must integrate the ERPs FOSS programs; these programs are multi-functional since they allow the user to execute the program depending on how he needs it. The FOSS programs allow access to their source code; this will enable users to make corrections in their code, significantly improving the program. 

FOSS can also be modified slightly for specific tasks that the user requires. In combination with the open license, this simplifies the development process for many companies and gives them the flexibility that is not available within the limits of a proprietary or commercial product.

<title-2>Free and Open Source (EPR) Software</title-2>

Today in our companies there is a more significant workload, and as our company grows this load will continue to increase, so it is recommended for these cases to implement the use of an ERP system, these systems undoubtedly have the possibility of relieving the workload within the company by helping in the planning processes, purchasing, sales, accounting, marketing, among others. 

It is essential to say dear user that ERP systems integrate all your activities in one single platform so we can say that the information will be kept organized and will be carried out step by step. Another positive aspect of ERP systems is that they facilitate communication between workers, whether from the same or different departments; this generates a greater and more efficient response to a possible problem, reducing operational risks.
