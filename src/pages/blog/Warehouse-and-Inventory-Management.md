<title-2>What is Warehouse and Inventory Management?</title-2>

<Br>

Inventory management in a warehouse is the process that carries and manages information of products and raw materials within a warehouse or place arranged for storage, information as tracking, audit process, and management for the fulfillment of the orders.

At the same time, technologies for inventory are attentive to the quantities per product in the warehouse, refreshing stocks to optimal levels based on historical sales data, always looking for product replacement in due time.

But first, you must understand that inventory management and warehouse management are not the same. We show you below the difference between both:

<title-3>Warehouse Management</title-3>

The management of warehouses has a higher scope if we compare it with the inventory, always maintaining the efficiency in the movements of materials within the warehouse. 

Among these large operations, we have the reception of incoming goods, tracking, stacking, and stock movement through the warehouse. 

Warehouse management monitors the product's existence on the shelves, maintaining the quality of the goods while they are stored and until they are shipped out of the warehouse.

Inventory management is extremely important for a company since it indirectly protects the company's assets in terms of material. 

Inventory management includes ordering and reordering inventory, maintaining accurate inventory records, forecasting demand, and warranty. It also compares the amount of product in the warehouse with profits and must be in perfect balance with what is sold and what is stored. 

An inventory management system is only one part of warehouse management, so it is much simpler. It provides important details of the total amount of stock held in a given storage location at any time.

<title-2>Some Practices for Managing Your Warehouse Inventory</title-2>

<Br>

<title-3>Define a Warehouse Manager:</title-3>

<Br>

To correctly manage their warehouses, all companies must place a manager in charge of all operations on-site, who is responsible for solving and making decisions at decisive moments. 

The manager will be in charge of scanning each corresponding item within the warehouse and keep correct control, as well as regulate the warehouse inventory management software to maintain an overview of your inventory, among others.

<title-3>Warehouse Layout:</title-3>

The physical layout of your warehouse will help or hinder your warehouse employees to quickly pick up, package, and ship items when a sale is made or a transfer order is placed.
