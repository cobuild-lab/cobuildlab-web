You can say that small business owners are the unsung heroes of our economy. They contribute to local economies by bringing growth and innovation to their communities and they help stimulate economic growth by providing employment opportunities to people who may not be employable by larger corporations.

In these last few months, the situation has become harder for them. With so much uncertainty about the spread of the disease, it’s hard to predict the effects of COVID-19 on B2B commerce. Every crisis of global proportions always takes its toll on the economy and decimates startups, SMBs, and enterprises equally, and business owners are caught in the frontline of the battle against COVID-19. 

With all of the restrictions put into place by governments all around the world, we wonder what’s next and what can we do to keep our business afloat. An alternative is the **process automation and new software solutions** applied to **B2B** and **small businesses** in the US and the whole world. 


<title-2>B2B software: a Great Option for Small Businesses</title-2>

As a manufacturer or wholesaler, if your customers are independent retail stores, retail chains, c-stores, or distributors, you are selling business-to-business (B2B). Sales, marketing, accounting, and support software all help you serve your business customers in the best possible way – and that’s exactly what the term “B2B software” refers to. It can help you automate several of your processes and manage some of your assets remotely.

If you're in this business, here's a video of what could happen to you this 2020 and beyond.

<title-2>Small businesses: Common Problems and its Software Solutions</title-2>

Now, let’s go over some of the most common issues that B2B companies and small businesses face during these times and some of the software solutions they can implement to stay afloat and ahead of the competition:

<title-3>1) Customer Service</title-3>

Customer service is the support you offer your customers — both before and after they buy and use your products or services — that helps them have an easy and enjoyable experience with you. It goes far beyond the traditional telephone support agent. It’s available via email, web, text message, and social media.

* **The Problem:**
The unexpected increase in demand for customer service has hit contact centers at a time when the customer service workforce is at a reduced capacity due to work-at-home constraints and the unfortunate case of agents falling ill due to the coronavirus.

* **The Solution:**
Automated customer service is a method of consumer support that is provided by an automated system such as a help center, chatbot, or other artificial intelligence. Automated customer support can be provided 24/7 and is used to both assist and reduce the cost of human support representatives.

<title-3>2) Product Distribution</title-3>

Distribution is a key element of any business, it guarantees the delivery of the product from the manufacturer to the customer.

* **The Problem:**
If bottlenecks happen in distribution, deliveries fall short, customers, retailers, and suppliers get angry, and trust is lost. For product distribution to be truly successful a continuous feedback loop needs to be implemented to ensure everyone is happy with the process and that any improvements that can be made are made.

* **The Solution:**
Implementing wholesale distribution software can make the range of workflows that you deal with daily much simpler, so you can go from working extra hard to complete a smaller amount of tasks to automating functions and conducting more business than before.

<title-3>3) Internal Communication</title-3>

Internal communications are all about promoting effective communications among people within an organization. It involves producing and delivering messages and campaigns on behalf of management, as well as facilitating a dialogue with the people who make up the organization.

* **The Problem:**

Without some kind of oversight, communications within the company can easily miss the mark. Some of the symptoms are:
Lack of employee engagement.
Irregular communication.
Communication inconsistency. 
Lack of feedback. 
No interdepartmental communication. 
Email overload

* **The Solution:**
Internal communications software can provide users with platforms that allow for direct and group messaging within the organization. These tools aim to be intuitive and convenient, facilitating quick conversations between team members. Gone are the days of sending sentence-long emails to receive one-word responses. Its key benefits:
Instant communication between team members.
Allows teams to connect regardless of location
Makes messages easily searchable
Provides a less formal virtual workspace for team communication
Connects the organization horizontally and vertically 

<title-3>4) Manufacturing</title-3>

In manufacturing, your money is made on the shop floor. That is why real-time availability of every detail involved in the entire manufacturing operation is crucial to the continued growth, success, and profitability of your manufacturing business. 

* **The Problem:**
As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the globe, manufacturing organizations face significant operational challenges. Some companies have temporarily shuttered factories in response to government restrictions or falling demand, but others are facing significant increases in demand for essential supplies.

* **The Solution:**
A complete manufacturing software solution will prevent unnecessary downtime while increasing manufacturing efficiency, quality, and profit margins. The right solution can help you:

Eliminate non-value added processes

<title-3>5) Manual Processes</title-3>

Lots of small businesses rely on manual processes on their day to day operations like using spreadsheets, filing cabinets, or using handwritten orders.

* **The Problem:**

These old school methods end up causing delays and unnecessary paperwork that slows down the workflow. Add to this the current limitations on staff due to the spread of the coronavirus and you’ll see that the time has come for a software solution that can help you on this issue. 

* **The Solution:**

Automation of back-end processes frees up staff time. Apart from the obvious benefits of efficiencies achieved, staff released from mundane tasks can focus on more creative jobs or acquiring new skills. It’s a software solution that can have a tremendous positive impact on your business.

<title-3>6) Customer Relationship Management</title-3>

They’re the ongoing connection between a company and its customers. This relationship involves marketing communications, sales support, technical assistance and customer service. The relationship is measured by the degree of customer satisfaction through the buying cycle and following receipt of goods or services.

The Problem:

In this era of dwindling staff numbers due to the global crisis, it’s easy for customer relations to go south, especially on the B2B market. The classical symptoms include:

Poor communication 

Customers kept waiting

<title-2>This is Our Experience on Process Automation and B2B processes</title-2>

**Massone Mechanical** sought to improve its processes in terms of customer service delivery and information management, mainly needed to automate the recording of calls or service orders maintenance or installation of refrigeration equipment, improve communication of services, and reception of them to field workers.

We met the Head of IT for Massone and started working on possible solutions to improve the workflow for the company, we tried a different version of ERP applications and Third Party solutions. We realized that a Custom Application needed to be developed and we spent several months reviewing the current process on the Company and what to do to improve them. Finally, we locked down a budget to start with the solution around September of 2018 and in January 2019 we released the first version. New features have been added until today with complete satisfaction from the customer.

**This is how the developed software looks like:**
