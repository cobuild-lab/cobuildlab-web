In recent years, there has been excitement around the transformative potential of technology in education. [Just in the United States alone, spending on education technology has now exceeded $13 billion.](https://anadea.info/blog/technology-trends-in-education)

Programs to promote the use of education technology may expand access to quality education, support studentsâ€™ learning, and help families navigate complex school systems. 

With the EdTech industry, learning becomes more dynamic, it saves money and improves the current setup of schools and colleges.

<title-2>What is EdTech all about?</title-2>

The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) defined educational technology as "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources."

Educational technology refers to the use of tools, processes, and technology strategies to improve learning experiences in a variety of settings, such as formal learning, informal learning, lifelong learning, learning on demand, workplace learning, etc. 

Educational technology began by improving very basic teaching tools, but have now rapidly expanded in recent years to all areas, including devices such as mobile technologies, virtual and augmented realities, simulations and immersive environments, collaborative learning, social networking, cloud computing, flipped classrooms, and more.

<title-2>Importance of EdTech for society</title-2>

The EdTech is essential today for several reasons such as student demands. They love to use technology outside of the classroom. 

Even children like to be interactive. Learning through technology has become part of their lifestyle. If we introduce technology in school, we are using something they want. Youngs will quickly get engaged in the learning process. And in conclusion, technology is making learning more fun and accessible to today's students.

We can't forget the teachers. They are being taught to use EdTech in their classrooms. 

If they know how to use technology in many useful ways, its job will be more comfortable. It helps to assess their students' knowledge as objectively as possible. It also helps them keep the whole class busy.

Teachers can devise creative ways to teach their students and keep them busy. 

Technology in education can improve relations between teachers and students when is integrated technology into subject areas.

It helps to teach and learning more meaningful and fun. Students are also able to collaborate with their classmates through technological applications. 

<title-2>Educational technology news that supports the industry grow</title-2>

Of many emerging technologies today, stands out as keys for the classroom of the future, 5G technology, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and voice mobile technologies, because they are creating more interactive learning experiences. And Artificial Intelligence-powered educational platforms can help improve students' engagement with world culture and history too. 

<title-3>* 5G</title-3>

[In the fall of 2018, NYC Media Lab launched the Verizon 5G EdTech Challenge in partnership with the Verizon Foundation and Verizon 5G Labs.](https://nycmedialab.org/recent-projects/2018/10/17/verizon-5g-edtech-challenge)

University researchers and nonprofit innovators were called to present a concept for building solutions for a mission: 

Leverage emerging technologies, such as 5G, to improve the quality of student education 

More specifically, how can emerging technologies take advantage of 5G to improve student readiness and engagement, STEM teacher training, and support them with special or diverse learning needs? 

5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology and promises high speed, low latency wireless technology. 

It could enable quicker downloads, more powerful networks, increased efficiency for businesses, and a near-immediate transfer of information. 

Autonomous cars, smart communities, the Internet of Things and Immersive Education are a few of the many high-potential industries highlighted by Verizon that 5G will transform. 

These are some suggestions about what will mean 5G for Edtech: a holographic teacher who can lead debates on specialized topics; virtual reality experiences that can help students with diverse learning needs; or connected devices that can help close gaps in the education of international students.
