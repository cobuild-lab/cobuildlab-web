Some days ago we share with you important information about [open source software](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-open-source-vs-proprietary-software/) in comparison with proprietary software. Now, we focus on Open Source software and we will do it from the perspective of one of the biggest technology monsters: Facebook. 

**Facebook Open Source Software** is most common that you may think nowadays and this is because Facebook’s software works well, and developers in the world can make it even better.

<title-2>Why Facebook is promoting Open Source Software?</title-2>

They have lots of reasons. One of them is that Facebook is a customer of open source software. In the beginning, the giant platform was built from a combination of Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP that is called LAMP platform. 

Also, we can make this assumption: If you were Facebook's owner which would be the strategy to find new and good engineers? 

For Mark and other executives of Facebook, the best strategy to find new people for this team it is searching in some of these open and collaborative platforms. 

Another reason for Facebook’s contribution with open source software development it could be the opportunity to get better its platform thanks to others’ contribution. 

Actually, they have GitHub accounts from its backend and frontend. If you want you can make a suggestion or visit it. 

In conclusion, Facebook is pro open source software from the beginning of the platform, and they will continue to be.


<title-2>These are some of Facebook’s open source software projects:</title-2>

There are lots of open source software that comes from Facebook. How we said they love this kind of technology. 

To show you some of this software we classify them according to its purpose. In that way, we can find:

**Facebook Open Source Software for Android:**

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

It is a framework to make native apps on Android and IOS using React, the web framework which was built by Facebook too. 

Some experts think that it is not possible to build from zero an app using this software, but we think that is not only possible do it, also it will be really good if you use this technology in the best way.

* [Redex](https://github.com/facebook/redex)

ReDex is an Android bytecode (dex) optimizer originally developed at Facebook. It provides a framework for reading, writing, and analyzing .dex files, and a set of optimization passes that use this framework to improve the bytecode. An APK optimized by ReDex should be smaller and faster than its source.

From F8 developer conference, Facebook launched this tool for Android. Basically, redex can make faster the Android Software using a few tweaks from the developers.

It is an Android accelerator that Facebook used to make 15% faster its open speed, and also this technology it is responsible for Facebook to be 25% more responsive. 

That was so good for Facebook’s team that they cannot save it just for them, and that's why we can have redex now.
