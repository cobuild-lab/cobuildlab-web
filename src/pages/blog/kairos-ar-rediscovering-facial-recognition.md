<title-2>**History**</title-2>

Founded in 2010 and based in **Miami**, Kairos is a venture-backed organization servicing a diverse global customer base.

Kairos in 2012 it received $500,000 in seed funding, bringing its total funding to $1.7 million. That same year they launched their first
product, Kairos TimeClock, which uses facial recognition to time employees at work.

Kairos always had the mission of being the main supplier of recognition for companies and thus be able to improve the experience between
human beings and machines.

Historically this type of technology has always been complex and expensive, even beyond the reach of the majority. But the Miami-based
startup wants to eliminate these challenges and make it easy.

They offer a cloud-based facial recognition API that lets developers generate and enhance applications with easy recognition
capabilities, allows them to integrate real-world analysis into applications to identify the number, sex, age and focus of faces in
images or videos; and an emotional analysis API that is used to recognize facial expressions and emotions in videos.

Kairos also provides IMRSV, a camera-enabled crowd analysis solution for marketing professionals that gathers continuous audience
analysis.
