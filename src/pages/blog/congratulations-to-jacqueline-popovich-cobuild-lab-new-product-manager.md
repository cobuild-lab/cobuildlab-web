<title-6 align="centered"> What is a Product Manager?  </title-6>

Well, there is not a right answer and It’s hard to say because as teams and organizations grow the role of a Product Manager tend to change as well, they could take a wide range of responsibilities in some companies or if the teams need it, these responsibilities shift to be more focused on what’s essential to build an amazing product. A PM is responsible for defining the mission and mission of a project and translates them to day-to-day activities making trigger decisions between business needs, user experience, and engineering while still making their customers happy. <br> </br>

Now at <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services">   Cobuild Lab</a>, Jacqueline will be working very closely with the development department collecting the input of the Solutions team to transfer market requirements into technical specifications to build solutions and products that meet customer demands in scope, time, and costs. She will also be in charge of developing and maintaining Product roadmaps, timelines, and strategic outlook for the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/portfolio">   portfolio</a> as she manages release, lifecycle, and end of life activities for all <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/">   Software Products</a> developed by Cobuild Lab's engineering team. With her years of experience in developing and introducing successful new media products, we’re sure that Jacqueline will become a valuable asset to our team. <br> </br>

We’re firm believers that every single time we’re writing a line of code we’re writing our future, we build software products such as web or mobile apps that run our lives and are changing the world we live in.
