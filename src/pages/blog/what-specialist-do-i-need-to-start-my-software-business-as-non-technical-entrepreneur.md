Did you ever think that you could start a business successfully by yourself? This is something that crossed our minds for once. But here, we are prepared to learn together, erasing myths that just won't let us grow up, and strengthening the right beliefs that translate into good practices and the success of our software business. 

<title-2>Here's the truth...</title-2>

It is not possible to start a business from scratch without the help of at least one person. And even less so if it is software that requires so much effort and knowledge. 

You must recognize your abilities and go looking for the right people to complement and improve your weaknesses. That's team building.

Even the most prodigious entrepreneurs in the history of software have relied on others to develop their projects. 

* Mark Zuckerberg needed someone in charge of finance and public relations, and his best friend was with him from the beginning. 

* Steve Jobs might not have been the same in the software world without Steve Wozniak's great effort. 

* Larry Page and Sergey Brin also complemented each other wonderfully to create and develop the giant Google. 

* [Maxeme Tuchman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxemetuchman/) is another example of a non-technical co-founder who can achieve tremendous things. 

She is a superwoman who has worked for the government and business from many years ago, and now, she decides to undertake as CTO on Caribu in the company of Alvaro Sabido. 

This company is based in Miami, and it is an excellent proposal for children's entertainment and learning. 

It offers a marketplace that brings to children and family members video-call to read books, draw, and learn together.

They are a good team. 

* Two family members can also be successfully co-founders and be the right team. Matthew Vega-Sanz and Michael Vega-Sanz are evidence of this. 

They are the CEO and the President of [Lula](https://lularides.com/), a car-sharing startup that connects college students to other students who want to rent their vehicles.

This app was based on Boston, but now then they relocate to Miami and currently are here developing his service on Miami colleges and taking it to the rest of the country. 

That's why we think it's fair and necessary that you learn and develop the ability to build software development teams. This activity is a challenge, but it is also fascinating, and we invite you to dive in. 

<title-2>To form a team, you must:</title-2>

<title-3>1. Have an effective leadership</title-3>

Leadership is the leading quality of every entrepreneur. If you are a good leader, you will be able to build and structure a good team or at least you have a better chance of achieving it, so work on your leadership. If you want some information on this subject, we invite you to read a previous post that we made on the tips to develop leadership.  

<title-3>2. Define its structure and limits</title-3>

This means the places and people who will make up the team. It also means defining and elaborating the process and the procedures that make it up, establishing the norms of conduct and follow-up, and generally shaping the team. 

<title-3>3. Establish the goals and roles of each member</title-3>

After shaping the positions you need in your team, clearly assign roles to all members, and each of these roles and responsibilities will depend on the plan and goals you set. Each member is a fundamental piece that will shorten the path to the goal. For this reason, the establishment of these two factors is essential to form a work team. 

<title-3>4. A personal selection of members</title-3>

Up to this point, roles, responsibilities, goals, and how you imagine your work team was defined, but still, none of the positions has a human face. This step to form a team is perhaps the most complex, choosing the right people. That fits into the profile you expect, and that is appropriate to your goal as the principles of your company. But that they are also trained and have the necessary skills and attitudes. We'll talk about some tips for this later.

<title-3>5. Create a vision and pass it on to your team</title-3>

As we told you, it's not possible to start a team on your own. You will always need at least one companion to support you with specific tasks. Ideally, it should be a working team. Now, your work team should not only be that, but it should also share that vision, that methodology, that same enthusiasm and beliefs of yours. This will make the work more harmonious, everyone will focus on the same goal, and even trust will increase from you to them and from them to you. This last step, although it could be related to the issue of leadership, is so essential when forming a team, that we decided to incorporate it in this process of building an ideal, functional and productive team to develop your software project. 

From time to time we can add in the following point some very particular aspects of the conformation of a software team. 

<title-2>To form a software development team, you must:</title-2>

Forming a work team for an enterprise is one thing, but when that undertaking is a software product, there are certain particularities that you must take into account:

* Look for the strength of your team. If you want to add developers to your project, even in the form of co-founders or CTOs, you must offer them confidence. Many times these people are very requested by different entrepreneurs or by large and medium enterprises. As a differentiating point, we do not only recommend that you offer them some participation in the company. Make them feel confident and show them financial stability. That's why it's so important to raise capital. Having enough money, you will have fewer mishaps to add developers to your team and that they have full commitment to the project you are developing. But be careful, not only the monetary issue matters. It's also essential that you get them to identify with your idea, that they can feel it and develop a sense of belonging. Improving this will give stability to you and the project you want to build. 

* Designates who is responsible for decisions related to technical aspects and software design. If you don't know it or haven't done it, do it. You can't be responsible for everything. Delegating is especially crucial in projects as complex and demanding as software development. 

* They should be self-sufficient or at least to develop the independence to find solutions or to express their thoughts so that they can do an action that won't hurt your software development team and just working by itself without depending on you. These projects are not about control or centralization but rather about autonomy.

* Don't rush the hiring process. Take your time to evaluate all the people you would like to incorporate, analyze all their profile, their history and if possible investigate them so that you are convinced that the person you are going to add is the right one for your team and will really fulfill the profile and the goals you have as an entrepreneur.

* Hire professionals. People who practice software development protocols and precise workflows and who may not have the most experienced in the market, if they know software development patterns. When we refer to professionals, we do not apply to graduate or certified developers, but to talented people, whose knowledge can be measured through a portfolio or perhaps some references. 

* The open coding environment could be decisive. If you encourage your team to be collaborative without meddling, a team mentality that allows members to present innovative ideas and solutions and that translates into a higher quality product. But this can only be done successfully if limits are set and if you also invest in the education and training of your team of developers.

* Link up with the developers you want to include in your team. Develop a trusting relationship, and this can help you incorporate those you wish into your team. Build a team base on a relationship of trust and good relationships that can give you a good software development team. A friend is more likely to support you when you're starting with no liquid payment but with shares within the company than someone you're far away from.

* You can bet on outsourcing. It is an excellent alternative to the one that many software entrepreneurs in our country make. It is a way to reduce costs for labor commitments, but if you bet on this type of modality, in which your team is scattered around the world, you must take into account the following:

1. Be flexible and allow developers to perform their daily activities or develop at the pace their country allows (taking into account schedules, etc.). 

2. Communicate more effectively. Regularly organize video-call meetings and multiply your communication channels so that distances are only territorial and the team can interconnect adequately. 

3. Bet on who has experience working in this way. Or at least, try to get one of the team members to have it, and make him/her a leader. The dynamics of distance work is very particular, but it does the job.  

* Work and train your team members. Whether the members were prepared, and they are very prodigious people, individual talents do not define the magic of a software development team. Group abilities or skills define it, and the capacity to work together in an organized way - the way of complimenting each other. 

Each person has talents and skills that if they are not the best, it can work correctly for your software development team, your communications team, etc. You have to work them, give them a methodology to follow and develop enough sense of belonging so that they can be cohesive. 

Here are just a few **tips and practices you can do to build your software development team** and that this is what you expect, the one that will lead you to success. Remember that can not, a good company for beginnings is vital. That's why we are willing to help you, to grow with you, and together develop your software business idea to learn in the process and also having a good time.
