Logistics management is the process that helps meet customer expectations and the goals of your commercial organization. 

It includes everything from tangible goods that are necessary for production (supplies, equipment, raw materials) to information, human capital, software tools involved, packaging, delivery, storage, handling, and even security. 

It is one of the main macro processes within any business (small, medium, or large). And thatâ€™s why it is essential to know its components and a brief explanation of why they are important; what can be done to improve them. 

We will see all this in this post below.

<title-2>Approaches to the Logistics Process</title-2>

Logistics management has a double focus: the inbound, which allows the proper internal functioning of the company, and the external, also known as outbound logistics, which channels from storage or point of origin to consumption by the customer.

This main logistic process includes the coordination and handling of supplies and materials needed for the production processes and any internal task of the company. It includes the transportation and storage of raw materials, and their delivery in the necessary stage for each process.

It involves human capital, but necessarily requires software tools that manage the level of supply and coordinate deliveries, purchases, and inventory.
