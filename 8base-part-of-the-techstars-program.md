Miami, FL. Dec 04, 2019 - Finally, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techstars.com/content/accelerators/announcing-techstars-austin-class-2020/"> Techstars Austin Class of 2020</a> was announced, and 8base is on the list! The company was chosen from over 1,000 candidates to be part of the latest Techstars Austin program. This was confirmed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amosschwartzfarb/detail/recent-activity/"> Amos Schwartzfarb</a>, Managing Director of Techstars Austin Accelerator.

TechStars is a mentorship-driven seed startup accelerator for Internet companies. The mentorship program is three-months long, which is conducted in three phases: mentorship, growth, and investment, and at the end of the program, the companies get to pitch their ideas to investors. It’s a long way process to get to be chosen, and thanks to their passion and consistency 8base team made it!
